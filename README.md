FOR PID CONTROL USING RMCS2303 LIBRARY ON NO-LOAD.

Ensure the RMCS-2303 library is installed in the Arduino IDE.
Connect the motor controllers to Arduino as described in the datasheet.
Assign unique slave IDs for each motor .

Motors are configured to run in Digital Speed Control Mode using Enable_Digital_Mode().
Current RPM is obtained using the Speed_Feedback() function.
PID logic adjusts the speed command to maintain the target RPM.
Current RPM, target RPM, and speed command values are printed to the Serial Monitor for debugging.
